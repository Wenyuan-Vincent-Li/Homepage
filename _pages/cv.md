Education
======
* B.S. in Engineering, Zhejiang University, 2014
* M.S. in Electrical Engineering, University of California, Los Angeles, 2016
* Ph.D in Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, Los Angeles, 2020

Research Experience
======
* Rare disease detection using Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) (07/18-09/18)
    * Work on developing a semi-supervised rare disease detection 
      framework using a generative adversarial network (GAN). 
      The model performance beats common classifier (logistic regression, 
      neural network, and random forest) by 5% in terms of 
      precision-recall AUC score.

* Medical image segmentation based on multitask learning (11/17-06/18)
    * Design a two-branch deep learning “Path R-CNN” 
      architecture which decouple the classification and segmentation 
      task. Region proposal network inspired by Mask R-CNN was 
      later added to our model. The new architecture boosts 
      the segmentation performance around 7% in mIOU.

* Collective neural dynamics: for better mental disease prediction and faster neuromorphic computing (06/15-09/17)
    * Design and emulate neural dynamics on Neuromorphic Circuits – 
      Spikey; a brain phase diagram was constructed for achieving better 
      mental disease prediction and faster neuromorphic computing.

* Skyrmion tracking by optical flow method (12/14-04/15)
    * Matlab programing to track Skyrmion moving using optical 
      flow algorithm.

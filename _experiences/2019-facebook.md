I got the opportunity to work as a machine learning intern at Facebook
in 2019 summer. During the 3-month internship, I worked on deep 
learning models for social search. Specifically, I combined the 
recent advancement of deep learning and information retrieval to 
incorporate raw text features into the search ranking system. Our 
experiments showed promise preliminary results by using raw text 
features in large-scale social search.

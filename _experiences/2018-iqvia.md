Inspired by the healthcare industry, IQVIA commits to providing 
solutions that enable life sciences companies to innovate with confidence, 
maximize their opportunities and ultimately drive human health outcomes forward.

In this period of 3-months internship at IQVIA, I developed a semi-supervised 
rare disease detection framework using a generative adversarial network (GAN). 
Our model leverage the large amount of unlabeled dataset with a limited labeled 
dataset, and applies generative model to boost the prediction performance. 
The result of our best model beats the common supervised-learning methods 
(logistic regression, neural network, and random forest) by around 5% in terms 
of precision-recall AUC score. We also build up a web API for user to interact 
with our model using Flask.

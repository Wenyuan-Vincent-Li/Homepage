Embark China provides unique extracurricular activities with an international focus to 
talented Chinese high school students. In todayâ€™s rapidly growing Chinese education industry, 
Embark has established itself as the leader in experiential learning by 
emphasizing the skills that modern, international university students need. 
Embark has partnered with U.S. universities and academic organizations across a variety of 
disciplines to offer academic environments and resources that reach the cutting-edge 
technologies.

I joined Embark China at Shanghai in 2017 as a AI teaching fellow for junior and senior high school students. 
Meanwhile, I also serve as an Associate Academic Director in charge of interview, course design, etc.

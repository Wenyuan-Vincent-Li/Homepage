### Abstract:
Prostate cancer is the most common and second most deadly form of cancer in men in the United States. The classiﬁcation 
of prostate cancers based on Gleason grading using histological images is important in risk assessment and treatment 
planning for patients. Here, we demonstrate a new region-based convolutional neural network (R-CNN) framework for 
multitask prediction using a Epithelial Network Head and a Grading Network Head. Compared to a single task model, 
our multi-task model can provide complementary contextual information, which contributes to better performance. 
Our model achieved state-of-the-art performance in epithelial cells detection and Gleason grading tasks simultaneously. 
Using ﬁve-fold cross-validation, our model achieved an epithelial cells detection accuracy of 99.07% with an average 
AUC of 0.998. As for Gleason grading, our model obtained a mean intersection over union of 79.56% and an overall pixel 
accuracy of 89.40%.

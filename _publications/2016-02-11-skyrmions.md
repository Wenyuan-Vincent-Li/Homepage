### Abstract:
Magnetic skyrmions, which are topologically
protected spin textures, are promising candidates for ultralowenergy
and ultrahigh-density magnetic data storage and
computing applications. To date, most experiments on
skyrmions have been carried out at low temperatures. The
choice of available materials is limited, and there is a lack of
electrical means to control skyrmions in devices. In this work,
we demonstrate a new method for creating a stable skyrmion
bubble phase in the CoFeB−MgO material system at room
temperature, by engineering the interfacial perpendicular
magnetic anisotropy of the ferromagnetic layer. Importantly, we also demonstrate that artificially engineered symmetry
breaking gives rise to a force acting on the skyrmions, in addition to the current-induced spin−orbit torque, which can be used to
drive their motion. This room-temperature creation and manipulation of skyrmions offers new possibilities to engineer
skyrmionic devices. The results bring skyrmionic memory and logic concepts closer to realization in industrially relevant and
manufacturable thin film material systems.

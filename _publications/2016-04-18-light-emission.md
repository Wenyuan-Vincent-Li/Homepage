### Abstract:
In this paper, a nano-pillar array integrated near quantum dots
(QDs), which serves as a Purcell cavity as well as a column antenna, is studied
in order to enhance the spontaneous emission (SE) rate of low emission
efficiency QDs. A systematic analysis for treating the isolated nano-pillar
and loose ordered pillar is demonstrated by solving the electromagnetic
field equations. As an illustrative example of potential applications, we
proposed a new structure that Germanium (Ge) QDs are located in close
proximity to the isolated Indium Tin Oxide (ITO) nano-pillar to raise its
efficiency. From the results of numerical calculation, it is predicted that ITO
pillars with slim (e.g., the radius is 25 nm and the height is 500 nm) and
flat morphology (e.g., the radius is 40 nm and the height is 60 nm) exhibit
superior enhancement over 20 folds. Finite difference time domain (FDTD)
simulation is utilized for demonstrating the distinctive enhancement when
QDs radiate at surface plasmonic resonance frequency of ITO nano-pillar.
It can be found that the QDs emission enhancement profile accords with our
results obtained from numerical analysis.

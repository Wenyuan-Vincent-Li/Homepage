In this work, the graphene is employed to form artificial magnetic conductor
(AMC). It is demonstrated that both the resonance frequency and bandwidth of graphene-based
AMC can be tuned by varying the external electric field. Additionally, the graphene-based AMC
with different geometries are examined and compared.

### Abstract:
Recently, semi-supervised learning methods based on generative adversarial networks (GANs) have received
much attention. Among them, two distinct approaches have achieved competitive results on a variety of benchmark
datasets. Bad GAN learns a classifier with unrealistic samples distributed on the complement of the support of the input data. Conversely, Triple GAN consists of a three-player
game that tries to leverage good generated samples to boost classification results. In this paper, we perform a comprehensive comparison of these two approaches on different
benchmark datasets. We demonstrate their different properties on image generation, and sensitivity to the amount
of labeled data provided. By comprehensively comparing these two methods, we hope to shed light on the future of
GAN-based semi-supervised learning.

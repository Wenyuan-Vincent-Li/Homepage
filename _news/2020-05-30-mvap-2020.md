Our paper "__[Semi-supervised Learning using Adversarial Training
with Good and Bad Samples](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.08540.pdf)__" has
been accepted by __[Machine Vision and Application (Springer)](https://www.springer.com/journal/138?gclid=CjwKCAjwrKr8BRB_EiwA7eFapicXr1bK36Av1JZKyvtw2ped19dX2vvbpVhiLW_m_0hSiqbqy3Ya4RoC2ysQAvD_BwE)__.
In this study, we combine good synthetic images and bad images 
(complementary data) to boost image classification accuracy in 
semi-supervised learning scenario. __[Read More]({{ site.baseurl }}/publication/2020-05-30-good-bad-gan)__
